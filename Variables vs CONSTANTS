#This is a comment
#variables vs constants
#variables are displayed in titlecase
#CONSTANTS are declared in CAPITALS

 #example of variable
 name1 = "Titans" 
 
 #variables store a value (can change)
 #variables cannot start with a number 
 #e.g. 1name = "titans" --> syntax error
 
 #example of constants
 FREETHROW = 1
 TWOPOINTER = 2
 
 #The values in a CONSTANT do NOT change
